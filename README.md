<h1>This plugin requires the official Woocommerce <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/ups-shipping-method/">UPS Shipping Method Plugin.</a></h1>
<p>The issue this plugin solves is when there is an individual item that is too heavy for standard UPS packages (150lbs), the UPS integration will simply say there isn't an available method for the shipment.</p>
<p>Woocommerce has a paid plugin to solve this but this free plugin does it with only a few lines of php</p>
